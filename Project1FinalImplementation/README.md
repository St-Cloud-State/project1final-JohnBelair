# Final Implementation for Project 1.

**Complete by October 25 (Friday). One submission per group.**

This is to be done on Github, one per group. The assignment requires you to create a final
version of the program. Start with the code developed for the Stage 1 implementation and add
the necessary code for the features designed in Stage 2
## Features to Implement

### 1. Simple Version of Warehouse (75 points, no waitlists)

In the simple version, we donâ€™t
have waitlists. If a product runs short or is out of stock when an order is placed, the
unfulfilled part of the order is put back on the wishlist. When a shipment of a product is
received, the quantity of product that arrives is added to the stock for the product. Orders
that have not been filled will have to be individually processed again, when needed.

### 2. Full Version of Warehouse (150 points)

In the full version, all the features are
implemented. If a product runs short or is out of stock when an order is placed, the
unfulfilled part of the order is added to the waitlist for the product. When a shipment of a
product is received, the waitlist items are filled first. For each waitlist item filled, an
invoice is generated for the associated customer. The remaining quantity of product is
added to the stock for the product.

## How to Demonstrate Testing?

1. Start a script session in your folder:

    ```bash
    script warehouseTest.txt
    ```

2. Compile the program:

    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```

3. Run the program:

    ```bash
    java UserInterface
    ```

4. Perform the following sequence of operations through the UI's menu options.
